### **Description:**
This map is created as a lab assignment (lab 1) for the Interactive Cartography and Geovisualization (GEOG 575) course. I have created a proportional symbol map using Leaflet with different operators such as overlay, sequence, zoom, and pan. The map demonstrates the total import values of 15 different countries from 1995 to 2022 and the data source is UN COMTRADE.
